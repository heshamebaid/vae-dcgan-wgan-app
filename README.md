# 🧠 VAE, DCGAN & WGAN Image Generator

![App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

A Flask-based web application that allows users to generate synthetic hand shetched images using three popular generative models:

- **VAE** (Variational Autoencoder)
- **DCGAN** (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)
- **WGAN** (Wasserstein GAN)

Built with PyTorch for the deep learning models and Flask for the backend, it features a modern UI where users can choose a model and instantly generate images.
